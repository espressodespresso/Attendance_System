# Attendance System
Third-Year University Project
***
## Description
This project is a university attendance system with inspiration from Studygoal by JISC.\
It is built using Typescript with Node. The project utilises the 'browserify' and 'uglify-js'\
to compile node modules to the web. Being my first independent full-stack project there\
loads of room for improvement, but relatively speaking I'm pleased with the final result.
